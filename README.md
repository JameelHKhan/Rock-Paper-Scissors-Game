# Rock-Paper-Scissors-in-Python

Week 3 assignments from Intro to Python at JHU

Skills: string input/output, data types, logical operators, and control structures

Part 1 (rps_ifelse.py): The program simulates a game of rock paper scissors between two players. It prompts player one and player two for their selection, validates each entry, and uses a series of if/else statements to determine the winner of the game. The program loops through seven iterations of the game afterwhich it outputs the total number of games won and lost by each player, the number of tie games, and the number of invalid games (where a player entered an invalid gesture).

Part 2 (rps_modilar.py): This code doesthe same as the code in part one but with the following differences:
- Modular arithmetic is used to determine the winner, loser, and tie games instead of if/else statements.
- When players are asked to enter their selected gesture, if the player enters an invalid gesture, the program will continue prompting until a valid gesture is entered.
- The program loops through 10 iterations of the game.
- The final output will display the total number of games won and lost by each player, the number of tie games, and the number of invalid gestures made by each player.
